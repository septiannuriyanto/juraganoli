Flutter project designed to solve real world problems<br>
Designed, coded and maintained by Septian Nuriyanto

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Septian.<br>
I've been working in coal mining industry for 11 years in Supply Chain Management Department. So many things going around in material management. Managing goods is like several knowledge application combined. However, hundreds of thousands dollar invested by the company, so we cannot mess around with the poor quality of material management system.<br><br>

## Goals
What I've done here is something called a lubricant management system. We all know that handling fluids are not an easy job. Fluids tends to dissolve, difficult to measure, easy to spill around, and other many things. The goal here is to make sure stated stock in your ERP system as close as possible with the actual measured stock. And to handle other aspects carefully an interface abstraction so every user will collect the data at ease without any hesitation.
